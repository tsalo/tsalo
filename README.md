### Hi there, I'm Taylor ðŸ‘‹

<!--
**tsalo/tsalo** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

I'm a Psychology grad student at Florida International University working with Dr. Angela Laird ([@angielaird](https://github.com/angielaird)).
I'm primarily interested in neuroinformatics (tool-building for cognitive neuroscience), reproducible neuroimaging research, and semi-advanced fMRI denoising.

I am the project maintainer for [NiMARE](https://github.com/neurostuff/NiMARE), a Python package for neuroimaging meta-analyses, and a core contributor to [tedana](https://github.com/ME-ICA/tedana), a library for denoising multi-echo fMRI data. I also contribute to a number of neuroimaging-related Python tools, like [fMRIPrep](https://github.com/poldracklab/fmriprep), the [physiopy suite](https://github.com/physiopy), and [heudiconv](https://github.com/nipy/heudiconv). Recently, I also joined the [BIDS](https://bids.neuroimaging.io) maintainers team.

I try to answer questions on [NeuroStars](https://neurostars.org) when I have the time, as well.

ðŸ”­ I'm currently working on improving NiMARE, converting BIDS to a machine-parseable schema, and building a workflow to process complex-valued, multi-echo fMRI data with synchronous physiological data.

ðŸŒ± I'm currently learning about complex-valued fMRI and systemic low-frequency oscillations (sLFOs) in fMRI.

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on advanced denoising tools for fMRI data. If you're working on this kind of thing, let me know!

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about using NiMARE or tedana.
