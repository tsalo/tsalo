### Hi there, I'm Taylor ðŸ‘‹

<!--
**tsalo/tsalo** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

I'm a postdoctoral research at the University of Pennsylvania working with Dr. Ted Satterthwaite.
I'm primarily interested in neuroinformatics (tool-building for cognitive neuroscience), reproducible neuroimaging research, and semi-advanced fMRI denoising.

I am the project maintainer for [`NiMARE`](https://github.com/neurostuff/NiMARE) (a Python package for neuroimaging meta-analyses), a core contributor to [`tedana`](https://github.com/ME-ICA/tedana) (a library for denoising multi-echo fMRI data), and a member of the maintainers team for the [Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS)](https://bids.neuroimaging.io). I also contribute to a number of neuroimaging-related Python tools, like [`fMRIPrep`](https://github.com/poldracklab/fmriprep), the [`physiopy` suite](https://github.com/physiopy), and [`heudiconv`](https://github.com/nipy/heudiconv).

I try to answer questions on [NeuroStars](https://neurostars.org) when I have the time, as well.

ðŸ”­ I'm currently working on improving NiMARE, converting BIDS to a machine-parseable schema, and building a workflow to process complex-valued, multi-echo fMRI data with synchronous physiological data.

ðŸŒ± I'm currently learning about complex-valued fMRI and systemic low-frequency oscillations (sLFOs) in fMRI.

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on advanced denoising tools for fMRI data leveraging multi-echo fMRI, complex-valued fMRI, or simultaneous physio acquisitions. If you're working on this kind of thing, let me know!

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about using NiMARE, tedana, or BIDS.

ðŸ“« How to reach me: Message me on the [BrainHack Mattermost](https://mattermost.brainhack.org) or email me.
