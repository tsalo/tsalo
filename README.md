### Hi there, I'm Taylor ðŸ‘‹

<!--
**tsalo/tsalo** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

I'm a senior software developer at the University of Pennsylvania working with Dr. Ted Satterthwaite.
I'm primarily interested in neuroinformatics (tool-building for cognitive neuroscience), reproducible neuroimaging research, and fMRI denoising.

I am currently the primary maintainer for [`XCP-D`](https://github.com/PennLINC/xcp_d), a BIDS app that denoises minimally-preprocessed fMRI data coming out of workflows like fMRIPrep and Nibabies, and [`ASLPrep`](https://github.com/PennLINC/aslprep), a BIDS App for preprocessing arterial spin labeling data.

I am a member of the maintainer teams for [`NiMARE`](https://github.com/neurostuff/NiMARE), [`tedana`](https://github.com/ME-ICA/tedana), [`nilearn`](https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn), and the [Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS)](https://bids.neuroimaging.io). I also contribute to a number of neuroimaging-related Python tools, like [`fMRIPrep`](https://github.com/poldracklab/fmriprep), the [`physiopy` suite](https://github.com/physiopy), and [`heudiconv`](https://github.com/nipy/heudiconv).

I try to answer questions on [NeuroStars](https://neurostars.org) when I have the time, as well.

ðŸ”­ I'm currently working on building post-processing BIDS Apps, including fMRIPost-AROMA, fMRIPost-tedana, fMRIPost-phase, and fMRIPost-rapidtide.

ðŸŒ± I'm currently learning about arterial spin labeling (ASL), as I maintain [`ASLPrep`](https://github.com/PennLINC/aslprep).

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on advanced denoising tools for fMRI data leveraging multi-echo fMRI, complex-valued fMRI, or simultaneous physio acquisitions. If you're working on this kind of thing, let me know!

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about using XCP-D, ASLPrep, NiMARE, tedana, or BIDS.

ðŸ“« How to reach me: Message me on the [BrainHack Mattermost](https://mattermost.brainhack.org) or email me.
