### Hi there, I'm Taylor 👋

<!--
**tsalo/tsalo** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
-->
I'm a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Pennsylvania working with Dr. Ted Satterthwaite.
I'm primarily interested in neuroinformatics (tool-building for cognitive neuroscience), reproducible neuroimaging research, and fMRI denoising.

I am currently a maintainer for [`xcp_d`](https://github.com/PennLINC/xcp_d), a BIDS app that denoises minimally-preprocessed fMRI data coming out of workflows like fMRIPrep and Nibabies.

I am a member of the maintainer teams for [`NiMARE`](https://github.com/neurostuff/NiMARE), [`tedana`](https://github.com/ME-ICA/tedana), [`nilearn`](https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn), and the [Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS)](https://bids.neuroimaging.io). I also contribute to a number of neuroimaging-related Python tools, like [`fMRIPrep`](https://github.com/poldracklab/fmriprep), the [`physiopy` suite](https://github.com/physiopy), and [`heudiconv`](https://github.com/nipy/heudiconv).

I try to answer questions on [NeuroStars](https://neurostars.org) when I have the time, as well.

🔭 I'm currently working on preparing xcp_d for its first major release and converting BIDS to a machine-parseable schema.

🌱 I'm currently learning about arterial spin labeling (ASL) in preparation to start maintaining [`ASLPrep`](https://github.com/PennLINC/aslprep).

👯 I’m looking to collaborate on advanced denoising tools for fMRI data leveraging multi-echo fMRI, complex-valued fMRI, or simultaneous physio acquisitions. If you're working on this kind of thing, let me know!

💬 Ask me about using xcp_d, NiMARE, tedana, or BIDS.

📫 How to reach me: Message me on the [BrainHack Mattermost](https://mattermost.brainhack.org) or email me.
